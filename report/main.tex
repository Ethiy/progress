	\section{The Dataset:}
~\\

	We have decided earlier in June to work on Nantes and Dijon in addition to
	Elancourt. As I explained later, the $3DS$ data for these regions are not
	well formated so that I can retrieve the building entities. In order to
	establish first a whole pipeline. I will deal with those regions later using
	the $CityGML$ data. In consequence, I will continue to work on Elancourt
	only, for now.\\

	I have also relabelled the zone I had labelled before. That is due to the fact
	that the taxonomy has evolved during the annotation. I have used $QGIS$ to
	annotate buildings' projected facets based on errors they showed.\\

	The errors have been subdivided, based on the labelling, into three classes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Unqualified Building Errors: Concerns the buildings that will not
		be taken into consideration,
		\item[-] Building Errors: encompasses the errors that affect the whole
		building (corrensponds roughly to $LoD0$ and $LoD1$ errors),
		\item[-] Facet Errors: concerns errors affecting only a facet.
	\end{itemize}



	\section*{Implementation:}
	Implementation status:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implemented:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[-] Reader: 3DS and OFF,
				\item[-] Geomview viewer;
				\item[-] Automated testing;
				\item[-] Algorithms on bricks: area, contour length, affine transformations;
				\item[-] Project 3D models in 2D;
				\item[-] Occlusion management.
				\item[-] Save projections into georeferenced vectorial images using GDAL;
				\item[-] Rasterize projections for DSM comparison;
				\item[-] Save raster projections into georeferenced images using GDAL;
				\item[-] Stitch Meshes (in order to stitch rooftops to facets);
				\item[-] Read Scene tree from XML file.
				\item[-] Improved rasterization: with no artifacts, pixel size $= 6 cm $ $\Rightarrow$ all  Elancourt in one day.
			\end{itemize}
		\item To add:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[-] Project 3D model on Camera.
		\end{itemize}
		\item To complete:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[-] Improve logging.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\section*{Ideas:}
	I have identified two possible approaches in mind:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] DSM and Z profil local comparison:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Simple Thresholding for inexistant buildings that are reconstructed with terrain height.
			\item[-] The difference still has structure - we can still see the facet borders - $\Rightarrow$ we can use the distribution of the difference (texture)  in order to determine if is noise or if the reconstruction missed something.
		\end{itemize}
		\item[-] Global building autoqualification:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Computed dual graph of each roof. Possibility of a bag of Features approach to get the similarity in neighborhoods.
		\end{itemize}

		\item[-] Orthoimage comparison:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Compute gradients "along" of building prints in order to detect any difference between inside or outside a facet/ building.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
