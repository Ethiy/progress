	\section{The Dataset:}
~\\

	We have decided earlier in June to work on Nantes and Dijon in addition to
	Elancourt. As I explained later, the $3DS$ data for these regions are not
	well formated so that I can retrieve the building entities. In order to
	establish first a whole pipeline. I will deal with those regions later using
	the $CityGML$ data. In consequence, I will continue to work on Elancourt
	only, for now.\\

	I have also relabelled the zone I had labelled before. That is due to the fact
	that the taxonomy has evolved during the annotation. I have used $QGIS$ to
	annotate buildings' projected facets based on errors they showed.\\

	The errors have been subdivided, based on the labelling, into three classes:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Unqualified Building Errors: Concerns the buildings that will not
		be taken into consideration,
		\item[-] Building Errors: encompasses the errors that affect the whole
		building (corrensponds roughly to $LoD0$ and $LoD1$ errors),
		\item[-] Facet Errors: concerns errors affecting only a facet.
	\end{itemize}
