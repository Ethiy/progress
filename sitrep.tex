	This summary reports the main resolutions taken during the progress meeting that took place in office \textbf{\#K316} in \textbf{12/21/2016}.
	\section*{Logistics:}
	Every one was present for this meeting.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Oussama ENNAFII,
		\item[-] Cl\'ement Mallet: IGN thesis co-director,
		\item[-] Florent Lafarge: TITANE thesis co-director ( joining from Skype).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Agenda:}
	
	We discussed: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Data availability:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] The need for both MVS and LIDAR based DSM: we do not really need both for the moment. We can do with any one of both based on based availability,
			\item[-] The need for oriented aerial images: we can use already available very high resolution ($resolution<0.25m$) OrthoImages. The oriented images can be added later to the pipeline since it can be fastidious to register images to each other;
		\end{itemize}
		\item[(ii)] Feature descriptors:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] The need to craft features specifically for each errors and set the vegetation occlusion aside for the moment,
			\item[-] The need to start with MNS and 3D model comparison first for feature extraction,
			\item[-] The feature extraction on aerial images are not yet mature: superpixelization and primitive detection may not be the best options to go for right now;
		\end{itemize}
		\item[(iii)] Implementation issues:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] It is adament to finish this part as soon as possible.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Decisions:}
	
	Based on the discussion, It was decided to act on the following plan, as soon as I come back from the holidays (i.e. \textbf{01/09/2017})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Ask Yannick Couturier for any DSM that he can get his hands on\\ while waiting for the official repository,\hfill {\color{RedOrange}[awaiting response]}
		\item[(ii)] Ask Sebastien Giordano for contacts regarding the oriented \\aerial images,\hfill {\color{Red}[by 01/09/2017]}
		\item[(iii)] Ask Cl\'ement DechÃªne for DSM and/or Ortho data for Toulouse,\hfill {\color{Red}[by 01/09/2017]}
		\item[(iv)] Explain the library structure using simple diagrams,\hfill {\color{Red}[by 01/10/2017]}
		\item[(v)] Compute attributes per facet - contour length, slope, area\\ or projections for instance,\hfill {\color{Red}[by 01/18/2017]}
		\item[(vi)] Visualize these attributes in 2D and in 3D.\hfill {\color{Red}[by 01/18/2017]}
	\end{itemize}
